Dimitris Pelkas had given PAOK a first-half lead from the penalty spot before PAS equalized with a Dimitris Manos goal that should have been ruled offside. PAOK also had a penalty kick saved.\\nOlympiakos stayed eight points behind PAOK with an emphatic 4-0 over Larissa in Piraeus, thanks to a Costas Fortounis hat trick and a Giorgos Masouras opener, his first goal in a red jersey.\\nAEK had its top scorer, the Argentine Ezequiel Ponce, on target in its 1-0 home win over Levadiakos. It is 14 points off the pace, and six above fourth-placed Atromitos that drew 1-1 at OFI Crete on Thursday.\\nPanathinaikos is now alone in fifth, three points behind Atromitos, courtesy of a 1-0 win at Panetolikos. Yiannis Bouzoukis gave the Greens their first league win in 2019 on Wednesday, despite playing with 10 men for over half an hour.\\nAris scored an important 1-0 win at Xanthi on Thursday to leapfrog its host and reach the sixth spot.\\nThere were also home wins for Lamia (2-1 over Apollon Smyrnis) and Panionios (1-0 over Asteras Tripolis).\\nSOCCER</th>\n",
